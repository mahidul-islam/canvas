# Training

Climbing is arguably one of the most challenging aspects of cycling. Here you can take a look at all the science and training approaches to climbing. 

### Hill Climb Demands

There are many different factors that make a good climber. Your specific Hill Climb training pack targets these specific demands by implementing the following structure to your plan; Base → Build → Climbing Specific.  

- Base - Your training pack will start with a base phase to build your aerobic foundation which is essential to being good at climbing. It will also develop your aerobic energy system, which is the primary system responsible for fuelling longer sustained efforts, such as climbing. The first block will also serve as a foundation to accommodate and enhance the work done in the upcoming 'build' phase and 'climbing-specific' phase.

- Build - Following the base phase, the build phase aims to further progress your aerobic fitness whilst also establishing your anaerobic and neuromuscular abilities. This phase is essential for improving the demands detailed in the 'cycling-specific' phase.

- Climbing Specific - After building your aerobic foundations and improving your anaerobic power/capacity, this phase will fine-tune the specific demands associated with climbing. This phase is also tailored to the specific type of climbing in your individual pack.

After following a Base, Build, and Climbing specific phase, you will progressively improve your ability to climb and conquer any mountain.  

### Power-to-Weight

- Power-to-weight is a crucial factor in determining climbing performance. It is quite simply the amount of power a rider is able to push through the pedals divided by the rider's weight.
- When climbing, gravity is the major factor stopping us from riding quicker, therefore the greater your power-to-weight ratio, the better you climb. Simply, the more watts you can sustain and the less you weigh, the faster you will climb.
- The great thing is that this offers two areas to target for improving your climbing. Losing a few pounds will result in improved climbing performance. If you do have some excess weight, it may be good to prioritise losing a bit of weight to help make those climbs easier. However, lighter isn't always better. By increasing power, you increase your speed up the hill and increase your speed in all other aspects of your cycling. Therefore a combined approach will lead to the biggest benefits.
- Here at Pillar, we advise that athletes target improving their power. It is easier, safer, and more effective than decreasing weight. By following our specific Hill Climb training pack, your power will soon increase, resulting in a better power-to-weight ratio.

### Practice 

- When the day comes to put your climbing ability to the test, it is important you have practised prior. The more climbs you climb, the better you will get at them.
- Pillar recommends that you complete scheduled intervals on climbs with a similar duration to the interval duration. If you don't have suitable hills near you, then you can copy the demands of climbing on most smart trainers using resistance and gears.
- Pillar recommends that when performing your hill-climb specific intervals that you try and replicate the same characteristics of the hill(s) that you are targeting. For example, if your are targeting to improve on steeper gradients then try and perform the hill-climb specific intervals on hills with a similar steepness. If you are targeting longer hills, then try and keep the gradient steadier where you can get into a rhythm for a longer period of time.
- Of course, not all of us have the luxury of having hills in our local training ground. What we are really are trying to replicate is the torque required when riding hills - that is the force you need to apply on each pedal stroke. A way to replicate this when hills are not available is with an indoor training and use a high resistance - or most smart training will replicate this automatically for you.
- It is also key to practice all the factors that contribute to your overall climbing performance. Make sure you practice and refine your climbing skills, nutrition, psychology skills, and pacing during training rides.

# Climbing Technique

Sometimes underestimated as a cycling skill-set, climbing requires a unique skill to get the best performance on a climb. The two primary skills required for optimal climbing are riding technique and gearing. Here is Pillar's guide to optimal climbing skills: 

### Riding Technique 

- The most efficient way to climb is in the saddle whilst spin a lower gear. This position will help keep your legs fresher for longer as it produces less stress and load on the muscles. Getting out of the saddle is more powerful but it requires greater energy contribution.
- Whilst seated, aim to keep your body position as smooth as possible and avoid any upper body movement as this is inefficient and results in wasted energy.
- Getting out of the saddle to stretch the legs or to add a short burst of speed can also be required when climbing. It can be useful to stand on the pedals when the gradient of the climb gets steeper as this allows you to utilise more of your body weight to produce a higher force.
- When riding in this standing position, use the lever hood bars, gently rock the bars from side to side by pushing to the left-hand side when the right knee is on its way down and to the right-hand side when the left knee is on its way down.
- Whilst out of the saddle you will pedal at a lower cadence. Therefore, prior to getting out of the saddle make sure you change up gears so that you have more resistance to press against, this will ensure that you maintain a good style and body position.

### Gearing 

- The gearing selection has a big impact on your climbing performance. Efficient shifting, picking the right gear, and optimal cadence are essential techniques that will impact your climbing performance.
- If you are riding out of the saddle you should opt for a higher gear. If you are riding in the saddle then opt for a smaller gear that allows you to spin at a comfortable cadence. Aim to select a gear that allows you to cycle at a cadence of around 75-90 rpm.
- Prior to getting out of the saddle, change up to a bigger gear to compensate for your lower cadence and to maintain consistent power. Change back into an easier gear when back in the saddle.
- If you're struggling to get up climbs then consider buying a compact chainset. This will allow you to have sufficient gears to climb up climbs without having to grind your way up.
# Nutrition
### Basic Diet / Weight Loss
Any reduction in weight can make a difference to climbing performance by increasing your power-to-weight ratio.  

Weight loss can be considered as a simple math problem, to maintain, lose, or gain weight you need to understand the energy balance equation. Energy balance is simply the relationship between energy intake (calories eaten) and energy output (calories burned) If you manipulate the numbers in the right direction, you'll achieve your desired energy balance.

Here are Pillar's simple tips to avoid weight gain and promote weight loss. 

1. Eat regularly 
   - Stick to a daily routine for your meals as you will be less likely to snack or overcompensate for missing a meal.
2. Eat less
    - As simple as it may sound, but eating less is required if you want to lose weight.
3. Avoid or limit food and drinks with high sugar and fat content
    - These types of foods are likely to be highly calorific. Swap these types of foods for healthier options.
4. Gradual weight loss
    - Even though the aim is to attain weight loss, this must be done gradually, over a period of time, at the rate of 0.5 - 1kg/ week
5. Cut down on alcohol consumption
    - Alcohol is one of the main factors that contribute to unnecessary weight gain due to the high-calorie content of these types of drinks. Make sure you control your intake and avoid any bingeing behaviour.
6. Eat protein-rich food
    - A relatively high protein intake can induce the feeling of satiety leaving you less hungry throughout the day at the same time helps you maintain lean body mass. However, make sure your intake is within the range of 1.4 – 1.8 g/kg body weight in order to maintain your overall energy balance.

### Carbohydrate Intake During Cycling

Running low on fuel always feels worse if you are going uphill. Fuelling adequately during training and racing is essential for optimal performance. Here are the recommended carbohydrate amount and types for fuelling your training or racing adequately.  
 
#### <30min
- For exercise less than 30 min there is no need to take in carbohydrates.
- However, you may want to take on small amounts of carbohydrates, if you feel hungry or low-energy. This won't cause any harm.

**Examples:** 
- Sports Drink: 20-25g

#### 1-2 hours       Target  CHO Intake:   30-60 g/h

- Eat easy to digest low fat and low in fiber carbohydrates
- 30g/h is probably enough, but you should aim to increase this amount over time and with higher intensity training.

**Type:**
- Single or multiple transportable carbohydrates
- e.g. glucose or glucose + fructose

**Examples:**
- Gels: 20-25g 
- Carbohydrate Sports Drinks: 20-40g 
- Bars: 20-30g

#### 2-6 hours      Target CHO Intake:   60-90 g/h 

- Eat easy to digest low fat and low in fiber carbohydrates
- Slowly build up your tolerance to higher carbohydrate intake over time to avoid any gastrointestinal discomfort.
- Start eating early and often.

**Type:** 
- Multiple transportable carbohydrates
- e.g. glucose + fructose or maltodextrin

**Examples:** 

- Gels: 20-25g 
- Carbohydrate Sports Drinks: 20-40g 
- Bars: 20-30g 
- Bananas: 20-25g 
- Rice Cakes: 20-30g

### Race Day

- Make sure you train your race-day nutrition. This is a mistake that many cyclists do and it can lead to poor performance and bad experiences on race/event day.
- Never try anything new on race day.
- See the recommended "carbohydrate intake during cycling" to guide your race-day nutrition plan.

### Supplements

There are many nutritional supplements on the market, many with performance, recovery, and health claims that are not supported by the scientific literature. We recommend that you improve your general diet and on the bike nutrition before worrying too much about supplements. 

However, if you are interested, here is Pillar's recommended nutritional supplement list that you may want to explore further for improving your climbing performance:

- Caffeine
- Beta-alanine
- Sodium Bicarbonate (Suitable for climbing efforts <6min)
- Nitrates (Beetroot Juice)

But the best magic climbing "Pill" will be following Pillar's **Hill Climb Training Pack**.  

# Psychology

Pain is an integral part of cycling especially when it comes to climbing, even after years of climbing experience. Having the ability to tolerate pain and tackle the mental obstacles that come with climbing is essential for superior climbing performance. Here are Pillar's top tips for increasing your pain tolerance and improving mental strength. 

1. Processing Pain: Practice and get familiar with the feeling of pain by repeatedly putting yourself in the hurt zone during training. Make sure you push yourself during those hard Pillar interval sessions. 
2. Split the Climb: Try splitting the climb into sections to make the intensity more tolerable. Focus your mind solely on the current section, concentrate on what's coming within that part, and forget about everything else.  
3. Ride within yourself: Keep calm and don't panic. Concentrate on finding a maintainable rhythm and focus on your breathing. Feeling in control of the climb will help you perform better.  
4. Remain Positive: Confidence is King, remain positive going into the climb and don't let your nerves get the best of you. Trust your own ability and the training you have completed, use this as positive reinforcement so that you can conquer any mountain. 
5. Deep breathing: Take a few deep breaths when you experience pain during the climb. This simple tactic will reduce pain by increasing oxygen supply throughout your body, relax muscles and decrease sympathetic nervous system activity. 
6. Positive self-talk: When the going gets tough, repeating high-energy positive self-talk such as "I can do it!" or "Almost there, I got this!" increases your tolerance to pain 
7. Distraction: Direct your attention away from the source of pain to aspects that will allow you to finish the race most effectively such as pedalling technique, race strategy, cyclists ahead of you, or focus on any repetitive task such as counting breaths or pedal revolutions. 

# Equipment

A bike constantly battles with three primary forces: rolling resistance, air resistance, and gravity. As you go uphill and the gradient becomes steeper, the gravitational force to overcome becomes greater. The mass is the only thing we can change to reduce this gravitational force (all other components that contribute to the total gravitational force are determined by nature). Therefore, the lighter your bike (and other equipment) the less gravitational force you will have to overcome when climbing a hill. Here are Pillar's tips to make your bike ready for hill climbing.  

1. Remove any unwanted accessories (Marginal Gains) 
    - Saddle Bag
    - Lights
    - Mud Guards
    - Bottles and Bottle Cages (if the climb is short in duration)
2. Gearing 
    - Make sure you have suitable gearing for climbing.
    - Even the pros use compact cranksets.
3. Bike Fit
    - A good bike fit will help improve efficiency and power during climbing.
4. Clean Bike and Lubed Chain
    - Cleaning your bike will remove a good few hundred grams of muck off.
    - Lubing your chain will reduce friction and result in watts saving.
5. Check your Bike 
    - Make sure you give your bike a thorough checking over. Don't leave anything untested.

# On the day tips

After all the hard training it's important to get the little things right on race/event day. Here are Pillar's on-the-day tips to ensure optimal performance is achieved. 

### Warm-up

- Including a warm-up before taking on a climb is essential for preparing your body for a hard effort. Not only will it help you to perform better, but it will also help protect your body from injury.
- Taking on a climb involves an effort above steady-state. If you attack a climb hard with no warm-up you will soon find yourself gasping for air and an uncomfortable burn in your legs. Including a good warm-up primes your energy production system ready for a hard effort and avoids you ending up with oxygen debt.
- In addition to priming your energy system, warming up increases blood flow and your body temperature.

### Pacing

- Pacing is one of the most crucial aspects of climbing performance. Although some climbs are just too steep or too short to pace and it is just a case of getting up them. However, for longer climbs, bad pacing and hitting a climb too hard, too early, the probability is you're going to blow up before the top.
- Correct pacing is one of the key successes to climbing. Whether you use a power meter or heart rate monitor you can use these tools to help pace your efforts. By stick within the power or heart rate zone required to complete that climb, you can pace yourself within the optimal range for any given climb.  However, it is important to learn the art of pacing without too much reliance on looking at a computer.
- It is always a good strategy to build into the climb and avoid going into the red too early on in the climb. Keep yourself disciplined at the lower parts of the climb and progressively increase your effort as you progress up the climb.
- Stick to your own pace. It can be harmful to try and stay with much quicker riders and you will end up losing more time in the long run.
- It is also useful to practice and experiment with your pacing during training. This will help you perform well on the climbs and avoid any major blowouts before the summit.

### Know the Climb

- Make sure you familiarise yourself with the climb. Establish a rough idea about the length, gradient, max gradient, and the likely estimated duration required for the climb. Take note of any significant points such as steep sections, rest sections, and technical turns.
- It's always a good idea to preview the climb in training if possible as this will give you a good feel of what's to come on race/event day. If you can't preview the climb in person a good idea is to use Google Maps and street view.

### Enjoy and have Fun 

- As painful as climbing can be, it's important that you have fun and enjoy the experience. Climbing will never be easy but you will get faster.
