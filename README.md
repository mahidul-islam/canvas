# A Experiment with Flutter canvas

Flutter apps can be built by running peanut with the Flutter SDK.

Installing:

```console
flutter pub global activate peanut
```

Running:

```console
flutter pub global run peanut:peanut
```

To create (or update) your local `gh-pages` branch to match what's on the
server.

```console
git update-ref refs/heads/gh-pages origin/gh-pages
```

This is also useful if you want to undo a `peanut` run.
